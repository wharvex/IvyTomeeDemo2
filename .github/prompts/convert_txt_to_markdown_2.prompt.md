# Convert TXT to Markdown

## Background

### Overview

I copied text from the official WCAG 2.1 standards site and pasted it into a text file. I need to convert the text into a nicely formatted Markdown file for use with agentic programming.

### Expected Attachments

A .txt file containing the copied WCAG 2.1 standards text. If no file is attached, please request it before proceeding.

## Objective

### Overview

Convert the attached .txt file into a well-structured Markdown file. Save the resulting Markdown content into a new file in the same directory as the original .txt file.

### Specific Tasks

- As you read the file, you will see references to the hierarchical sections of the WCAG rules (e.g. 1., 1.1, 1.1.1, etc). Create a hierarchy of Markdown headings to approximate what you can infer about the original structure based on the numbering.
