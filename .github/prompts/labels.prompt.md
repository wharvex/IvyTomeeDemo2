### Read files

Look at the attached FTL (Freemarker Template Language) and/or HTML files.

They could be attached as:

- the files themselves
- a markdown file containing links to files
- a directory containing the files
- a combination of the above

If there are no attached files, ask for them before proceeding.

### Edit files

Apply edits to these files to improve their accessibility in the following ways:

- Ensure all form controls have properly associated `<label>` elements.
- Add `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements where appropriate to group related form controls.

If it seems like a file already has the improvements mentioned above, do not edit it.

### Keep checklist

Keep a running checklist of which files you looked at, which ones needed edits, which ones did not need edits, and what edits you made to each file.

Save this checklist in a markdown file in the .github/checklists directory.

Use this checklist to know when you are done. You are done when all files have been looked at, and all files needing edits have been edited.

### DO-NOT's

Do not stop working until you are done.

Do not try to run any terminal commands.

Do not write any python scripts or powershell scripts.

Do not try to run the get_errors tool.

Do not look at or try to edit any other files besides the attached HTML/FTL files.
