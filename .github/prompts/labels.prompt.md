Use subagents to look at the attached HTML/FTL (Freemarker Template Language) files.

They could be attached as:

- the files themselves
- a markdown file containing links to files
- a directory containing the files
- a combination of the above

In these files, the subagents should:

- Edit them to ensure all form controls have properly associated `<label>` elements.
- Add `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements where appropriate to group related form controls.

The subagents should NOT edit a file if it already has proper labels and fieldsets.

Keep a running checklist of which files the subagents looked at and which ones they edited.

Save this checklist in a markdown file named `labels-checklist.md` in the .github/checklists directory.

Use this checklist to know when you are done.

Do not stop working until you are done.

Do not try to run any terminal commands.
