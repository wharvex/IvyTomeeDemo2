### Read files

Look at the attached HTML/FTL (Freemarker Template Language) files.

They could be attached as:

- the files themselves
- a markdown file containing links to files
- a directory containing the files
- a combination of the above

If there are no attached files, ask for them before proceeding.

### Edit files

Apply edits to these files to improve their accessibility.

We need full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, so you should look for any accessibility issues in the files and fix them.

If it seems like a file is already fully compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA, do not edit it.

### Keep checklist

Keep a running checklist of which files you looked at, which ones needed edits, which ones did not need edits, and what edits you made to each file.

Save this checklist in a markdown file in the .github/checklists directory.

Use this checklist to know when you are done. You are done when all files have been looked at, and all files needing edits have been edited.

### DO-NOT's

Do not stop working until you are done.

Do not try to run any terminal commands.

Do not write any python scripts or powershell scripts.

Do not try to run the get_errors tool.

Do not look at or try to edit any other files besides the attached HTML/FTL files.
