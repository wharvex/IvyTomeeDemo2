# 4. Robust

Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Guideline 4.1 Compatible

Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

### Success Criterion 4.1.1 Parsing (Level A)

In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features.

**Note 1:**
This success criterion should be considered as always satisfied for any content using HTML or XML.

**Note 2:**
Since this criterion was written, the HTML Living Standard has adopted specific requirements governing how user agents must handle incomplete tags, incorrect element nesting, duplicate attributes, and non-unique IDs. [HTML]

Although the HTML standard treats some of these cases as non-conforming for authors, it is considered to "allow these features" for the purposes of this success criterion because the specification requires that user agents support handling these cases consistently. In practice, this criterion no longer provides any benefit to people with disabilities in itself.

Issues such as missing roles due to inappropriately nested elements or incorrect states or names due to a duplicate ID are covered by different success criteria and should be reported under those criteria rather than as issues with 4.1.1.

### Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)

For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

**Note:**
This success criterion is primarily for web authors who develop or script their own user interface components. For example, standard HTML controls already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.

### Success Criterion 4.1.3 Status Messages (Level AA)

In content implemented using markup languages, status messages can be programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus.
